## Testing & Validation

### Regression Detection Tests
```
✅ 7/7 tests passed

Test 1: No regression (equal values) - PASS
Test 2: No regression (improvement) - PASS  
Test 3: CPU regression detected (>10%) - PASS

## System Architecture

```
PR Event → Build → Test → Analyze → Compare → Pass/Fail
                                    ↓
                              [Baseline]
                                    ↓
                        [PR Comment] + [CI Result]
                                    ↓
                         (main/develop only)
                                    ↓
                          [Update Baseline]
```

### Key Components

1. **Performance Tests**: `screeps-performance-server` runs bot code
2. **Logging**: Captures CPU, memory, bucket metrics
3. **Analysis**: Parses logs and calculates statistics
4. **Comparison**: Loads baseline and detects regression
5. **Reporting**: Generates JSON and Markdown reports
6. **CI Integration**: Posts comments and fails on regression
7. **Baseline Management**: Updates baselines on main/develop

## Usage Examples

### For Developers

```bash
# Before committing a PR - test locally
npm run test:perf:compare

# Output shows if regression detected:
# ✅ No performance regression detected
# or
# ❌ Performance regression detected
#    Avg CPU increased by 12.5%
```

### For CI/CD

```yaml
# Runs automatically on PR
# Workflow posts comment like:

📊 Performance Test Results

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Avg CPU | 5.330 | ✅ |
| Max CPU | 17.910 | ✅ |

✅ No Performance Regression
Performance is within acceptable limits.
```

### For Baseline Updates

```bash
# Only on main/develop branches after successful merge
# Automated via CI:
node scripts/update-baseline.js
# Creates: performance-baselines/main.json
# Archives: performance-baselines/history/2026-01-23_main_abc1234.json
```
